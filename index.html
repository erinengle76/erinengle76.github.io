                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>Hometown Facts:</b> I am a proud Montanan, raised in Missoula, MT. I attended Hellgate Highschool, which 
                is named after its location near the mouth of Hellgate Canyon. The canyon was named as, similar to the Tusken Raiders shooting
                at the pod racers in Star Wars: Episode I, members of the Blackfeet Nation would perch along the edges of the canyon and attack
                anyone who tried to pass through the canyon. Missoula is located in the Western part of the state in the Rocky Mountains. Growing
                up in an outdoor enthusiast's paradise, I spent lots of time exploring trails, floating rivers, and visiting Glacier National
                Park growing up. Should you ever visit Western Montana, I would be more than happy to provide a handful of recommendations.</font> </p>
                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>My Second "Home":</b> I attended American University in Washington, DC for my undergraduate degree. From
                2014 through 2018, I studied business, language, and culture with a focus in Arabic. Upon graduation, I landed a job in Northern
                Virginia and stayed in the DC area for 4 additional years working with a mid-size IT and Management Consulting Firm. Here, I worked within the 
                operations team, directly supporting the COO and working on a variety of tasks including ISO 9001:2015 certifications, HR process improvement, 
                and proposals/contracts management. Washington, DC will always hold a soft spot in my heart. From the Smithsonian museums, to the music scene; 
                the Monuments to the history of politics; this city moves at a quick pace, but somehow remembers to stop and smell the roses. I hope to make 
                it back someday soon.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>Gaduate School:</b> I recently moved from Washington, DC to Oakland, CA to start school at UC Berkeley. At Cal,
                I am part of the Master of Information Management Systems Program within the School of Information. Here I hope to improve my technical skillset by
                loosely following the applied machine learning and data science track within the program. I feel very fortunate to have landed a spot in a program
                with so many talented and thoughtful individuals who will surely help change this world for the better.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>Climate Tech:</b> When the pandemic started, I had already begun taking technical courses to prepare for
                graduate school applications. This was the first step in my pivot away from the world of business operations, so at this time I also began to 
                consider what type of problems I wanted to solve for a living; where did I want my contributions to fall in this world? I began listening to 
                climate technology podcasts, as the climate change problem had always fascinated me, and honed in on climate informatics and computational 
                sustainability. Serendipitously, I became involved with a research project analyzing time series produced by industrial grade HVAC devices
                around the same time (Summer 2021). This interest has grown into a passion and I love to keep up to date with the latest podcasts and literature
                in the feild. </font></p>
                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>Sport:</b> I grew up figure skating competitively and hold a USFS 'gold medal' in Moves in the Field. As 
                part of my training for skating, I was classically trained in ballet, up to learning to dance on pointe. I had decided that the pointe shoes were
                ruining my feet and I preferred skating. As such, I opted out of the pointe track but continued to dance through highschool. These days, I skate
                recreationally, but prefer outdoor activities like hiking and take variety of fitness classes at my gym.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>Languages:</b> I learned French in highschool, which improved over a 6-month stint abroad in the South of 
                France (<i>pinkies up</i>). In college, I swapped French with Arabic and spent the other 6 months of my year abroad studying in Amman, Jordan. 
                My language journey at Cal has shifted to computer languages where I am currently brushing up on my Python and R. I also have basic experience in
                Java.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"; style="line-height:1.4"> <font size="-1"><b>Live Music:</b> My dad is a live audio engineer, so I grew up "in the industry". In college, I picked up
                a side gig at a string of music venues that included the historic 9:30 Club and the Anthem. These people became my second family and I held the 
                job post-graduation, thanks to the flexibility of my day job. My partner, Andrey, and I love a good concert and spend a lot of our free time 
                attending concerts and festivals.</font></p>
